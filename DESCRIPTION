Description: This package provides tutorials for "Tutorials for Analyzing US 
  Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R" by Kyle Walker. In an ideal
  world, students would read the book and type in all the associated R commands
  themselves. Sadly, that often does not happen. These tutorials allow
  students to demonstrate (and their instructors to be sure) that all work
  has been completed. See the tutorial.helpers package for a background
  discussion of the tool and approach.
