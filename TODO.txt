Start with Chapter 3. Note that some (but not all!) of this material is in the three currently existing tutorials. Copy/paste the relevant material directly from there.


Break up the current tutorials into sections which map directly onto different chapters.

Make sure to only load the libraries which are needed in that chapter.

Introduce all the necessary libraries with questions, telling students to load each of them by hand, each in a separate question.

Use images from the book.
